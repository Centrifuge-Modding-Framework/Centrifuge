Welcome to Centrifuge Mod SDK. Thanks for giving us a shot!
Below lies a quick-start package and a few useful links to get you started.

### The bare-bones mod.json to spare you the typing.

{
  "FriendlyName": "ExampleMod",
  "Author": "You",
  "Contact": "0451",
  "ModuleFileName": "ExampleMod.dll",
  "Dependencies": [],
  "SkipLoad": false,
  "Priority": 10
}

Create a file called "mod.json" in the root of your solution and set its
copy behavior in file properties window to "Copy If Newer". That's it!
